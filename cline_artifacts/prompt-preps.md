#### Testing
- The "Key" input text box should have the "Find" button connected and aligned similar to bootstrap's input-group-append class. Use flexbox to acheive this.

#### Application Testing
The progress.md file has been updated. All completed and verified items have been checked off and the next phases have been adjusted.

**Issues Discovered**
- Search/filter not implemented
- Update not implemented
- vite.svg throws a 404

#### Next Steps
1. Add a button "Find Entries" that gets entries that match the key entered into the form. Results should be paginated
2. Implement the update feature: click on an entry to load it into the editor
3. Create a favicon svg to replace the missing vite.svg which is currently returning a 404
