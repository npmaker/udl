## Known Issues

### Resolved Issues ‚úÖ
- **vue-tsc Build Failure**: Fixed by updating vue-tsc from v1.8.0 to v2.0.0
- **TypeScript Compilation**: Now working correctly with Vue 3 components

### Current Limitations
- **Supabase Backend**: Not yet configured for production
- **Environment Variables**: Need to be set up for deployment
- **Testing**: Manual testing needed after Supabase setup

### Anticipated Challenges
- **Supabase Configuration**: Setting up proper RLS policies for data isolation
- **TypeScript Integration**: Ensuring proper typing throughout Vue components
- **Performance**: Handling large datasets efficiently with pagination
- **Error Handling**: Creating user-friendly error messages for all failure cases

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Scope Refinement
- **Original**: Generic "udl" project directory name
- **Refined**: Universal Data Logger API with clear use cases
- **Rationale**: Project brief clarified the actual requirements

### Technology Stack Validation
- **Vue 3 + TypeScript**: Confirmed as optimal for type safety and modern development
- **Supabase**: Validated as best choice for rapid backend development
- **Vercel**: Confirmed for seamless deployment and serverless functions
- **Tailwind**: Validated for rapid UI development without custom CSS complexity

### Architecture Decisions
- **RESTful API**: Simple, predictable endpoints over GraphQL complexity
- **JSONB Storage**: Maximum flexibility for arbitrary data
- **JWT Authentication**: Standard, secure approach with Supabase integration
- **Row Level Security**: Database-level security for user data isolation

## Development Milestones

### Completed ‚úÖ
1. **Project Analysis**: Understanding requirements from existing brief
2. **Memory Bank Creation**: Complete documentation foundation
3. **Architecture Design**: System patterns and technical decisions
4. **Development Planning**: Clear roadmap and next steps
