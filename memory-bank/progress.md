- **Refined**: Universal Data Logger API with clear use cases
- **Rationale**: Project brief clarified the actual requirements

### Technology Stack Validation
- **Vue 3 + TypeScript**: Confirmed as optimal for type safety and modern development
- **Supabase**: Validated as best choice for rapid backend development
- **Vercel**: Confirmed for seamless deployment and serverless functions
- **Tailwind**: Validated for rapid UI development without custom CSS complexity

### Architecture Decisions
- **RESTful API**: Simple, predictable endpoints over GraphQL complexity
- **JSONB Storage**: Maximum flexibility for arbitrary data
- **JWT Authentication**: Standard, secure approach with Supabase integration
- **Row Level Security**: Database-level security for user data isolation

### Feature Implementation Decisions
- **Search Implementation**: Used Supabase's `ilike` for case-insensitive key search
- **Edit UX**: Click-to-edit pattern with form pre-population and smooth scrolling
- **State Management**: Reactive updates to both main entries and search results
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error messaging across all operations
