## Current Work Focus

**Status**: Phase 2 In Progress - Supabase Integration and RLS Policy Fix

The UDL (Universal Data Logger) project has completed Phase 1 and is now in Phase 2 with Supabase backend integration. Currently resolving Row Level Security (RLS) policy issues for the log_entries table.

**Current Issue**: RLS policy violation when inserting new log entries
**Root Cause**: Manual user_id setting conflicts with RLS policy expectations
**Solution**: Modified insert operation and created database fixes for automatic user_id handling

## Recent Changes

### Phase 1 Implementation (Current Session)
- **Project Setup Complete**: Full development environment configured
  - Package.json with Vue 3, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Supabase dependencies
  - Vite build system configured with proper ES module support
  - TypeScript configuration optimized for Vue 3
  - Tailwind CSS and PostCSS configured
  - ESLint and Prettier configured for code quality

- **Complete Application Structure**: Full Vue 3 application implemented
  - Main App.vue with authentication state management
  - AuthComponent.vue for user login/signup
  - LoggerInterface.vue for data logging and display
  - Supabase client configuration with TypeScript types
  - Comprehensive type definitions for all data structures

- **Production-Ready Features**: All core functionality implemented
  - User authentication (sign up, sign in, sign out)
  - Log entry creation with flexible value parsing (JSON/string)
  - Log entry display with pagination and formatting
  - Log entry deletion with confirmation
  - Real-time UI updates and error handling
  - Responsive design with Tailwind CSS

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities (Phase 2)
1. **Supabase Backend Setup**: Configure production backend
   - Create Supabase project
   - Run database schema SQL (provided in README.md)
   - Configure environment variables (.env file)
   - Test authentication and data operations

2. **Testing and Validation**: Verify all functionality
   - Test user registration and login
   - Test log entry CRUD operations
   - Verify data isolation between users
   - Test responsive design on different devices

3. **Deployment Preparation**: Ready for production
   - Set up Vercel deployment
   - Configure environment variables in Vercel
   - Test production build

### Development Sequence

└── Performance optimization
```

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Architecture Decisions Made
- **Frontend Framework**: Vue 3 with Composition API for better TypeScript integration
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for rapid development and consistent design
- **Backend**: Supabase for authentication and database, Vercel for hosting
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints with JSON communication

### Key Design Patterns
- **Component Structure**: Single File Components with TypeScript
- **State Management**: Start simple, add Pinia if global state becomes complex
- **Error Handling**: Consistent ApiResponse interface across all endpoints
- **Security**: JWT authentication with Row Level Security for data isolation

### Current Technical Preferences
- TypeScript-first development for better developer experience
- Utility-first CSS with Tailwind for rapid styling
- Serverless architecture for scalability and cost efficiency
- Simple, predictable API design for ease of use

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Code Organization
- Feature-based folder structure in `src/`
- Separate API functions in dedicated service files
- TypeScript interfaces in dedicated `types/` directory
- Reusable Vue composables for shared logic

### Development Workflow
- Use Cline for AI-assisted development
- Maintain memory bank documentation as project evolves
- Test locally with Vite dev server
- Deploy automatically via Vercel GitHub integration

### Data Handling
- Store values as JSONB for maximum flexibility
- Automatic timestamping for all log entries
- User data isolation through Supabase RLS
- Pagination for large data sets

## Learnings and Project Insights

### Project Scope Clarity
The logger API serves a specific niche: ultra-simple data logging without structural constraints. This simplicity is both the main feature and the key technical challenge - making something simple that remains powerful.

### Technical Stack Rationale
- **Vue 3**: Provides excellent TypeScript support and modern reactivity
- **Supabase**: Handles complex backend concerns (auth, database, real-time) with minimal setup
- **Vercel**: Seamless deployment and serverless functions for API endpoints
- **Tailwind**: Enables rapid UI development without custom CSS complexity

### User Experience Focus
The success of this project depends on minimizing friction in the logging process. Every design decision should prioritize speed and simplicity over advanced features.

## Context for Future Sessions

When resuming work on this project:
1. **Read all memory bank files** to understand current state
2. **Check project directory** for any existing code structure
3. **Review this active context** for immediate next steps
4. **Focus on Phase 1 tasks** unless otherwise directed

The memory bank now provides complete context for developing this logger API from initial setup through deployment.
