# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

**Status**: Project initialization phase - Memory bank setup complete

The logger API project is in its initial setup phase. We have established the complete memory bank structure and documented the project's core requirements, architecture, and technical approach.

## Recent Changes

### Memory Bank Initialization (Current Session)
- Created complete memory bank structure with all core files
- Moved and enhanced project brief from `cline_docs/` to memory bank
- Documented product context, system patterns, and technical specifications
- Established foundation for all future development work

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Project Setup**: Initialize the actual codebase structure
   - Create package.json with dependencies
   - Set up Vite + Vue 3 + TypeScript configuration
   - Configure Tailwind CSS
   - Set up ESLint and Prettier

2. **Supabase Configuration**: Set up backend infrastructure
   - Create Supabase project
   - Configure database schema (log_entries table)
   - Set up Row Level Security policies
   - Configure authentication

3. **Core Frontend Structure**: Build basic application shell
   - Create main Vue application structure
   - Implement authentication components
   - Build basic logging interface
   - Set up API service layer

### Development Sequence
```
Phase 1: Foundation Setup
├── Project initialization (package.json, configs)
├── Supabase setup and schema
└── Basic Vue app structure

Phase 2: Core Features
├── Authentication system
├── Log creation functionality
└── Log retrieval and display

Phase 3: Enhancement
├── UI/UX improvements
├── Error handling
└── Performance optimization
```

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Architecture Decisions Made
- **Frontend Framework**: Vue 3 with Composition API for better TypeScript integration
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for rapid development and consistent design
- **Backend**: Supabase for authentication and database, Vercel for hosting
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints with JSON communication

### Key Design Patterns
- **Component Structure**: Single File Components with TypeScript
- **State Management**: Start simple, add Pinia if global state becomes complex
- **Error Handling**: Consistent ApiResponse interface across all endpoints
- **Security**: JWT authentication with Row Level Security for data isolation

### Current Technical Preferences
- TypeScript-first development for better developer experience
- Utility-first CSS with Tailwind for rapid styling
- Serverless architecture for scalability and cost efficiency
- Simple, predictable API design for ease of use

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Code Organization
- Feature-based folder structure in `src/`
- Separate API functions in dedicated service files
- TypeScript interfaces in dedicated `types/` directory
- Reusable Vue composables for shared logic

### Development Workflow
- Use Cline for AI-assisted development
- Maintain memory bank documentation as project evolves
- Test locally with Vite dev server
- Deploy automatically via Vercel GitHub integration

### Data Handling
- Store values as JSONB for maximum flexibility
- Automatic timestamping for all log entries
- User data isolation through Supabase RLS
- Pagination for large data sets

## Learnings and Project Insights

### Project Scope Clarity
The logger API serves a specific niche: ultra-simple data logging without structural constraints. This simplicity is both the main feature and the key technical challenge - making something simple that remains powerful.

### Technical Stack Rationale
- **Vue 3**: Provides excellent TypeScript support and modern reactivity
- **Supabase**: Handles complex backend concerns (auth, database, real-time) with minimal setup
- **Vercel**: Seamless deployment and serverless functions for API endpoints
- **Tailwind**: Enables rapid UI development without custom CSS complexity

### User Experience Focus
The success of this project depends on minimizing friction in the logging process. Every design decision should prioritize speed and simplicity over advanced features.

## Context for Future Sessions

When resuming work on this project:
1. **Read all memory bank files** to understand current state
2. **Check project directory** for any existing code structure
3. **Review this active context** for immediate next steps
4. **Focus on Phase 1 tasks** unless otherwise directed

The memory bank now provides complete context for developing this logger API from initial setup through deployment.
