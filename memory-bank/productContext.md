# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists

Modern users generate countless small pieces of information throughout their day - quick notes, measurements, observations, temporary data, or random thoughts that need to be captured quickly. Traditional note-taking apps are often too structured, databases too complex, and spreadsheets too rigid for this use case.

This logger API fills the gap by providing a dead-simple way to store arbitrary data with minimal friction.

## Problems It Solves

### Primary Problems
- **Friction in Data Capture**: Existing solutions require too many steps to store simple data
- **Structure Overhead**: Most systems force users into predefined schemas
- **Device Limitations**: Data often gets trapped on a single device
- **Access Complexity**: Users need simple, fast access from any internet-connected device

### Secondary Problems
- **Data Loss**: Quick notes often get lost in various apps
- **Context Loss**: Timestamps help maintain when data was captured
- **Sharing Difficulty**: Hard to share or access data across devices

## How It Should Work

### Core User Flow
1. **Quick Authentication**: Fast login/signup process
2. **Instant Logging**: POST key/value pairs with minimal payload
3. **Easy Retrieval**: GET requests to fetch data with filtering options
4. **Timestamp Tracking**: Automatic timestamping for all entries

### User Experience Goals
- **Speed**: Sub-second response times for logging
- **Simplicity**: Minimal UI, clear API endpoints
- **Reliability**: Data never gets lost
- **Accessibility**: Works on any device with internet

### API Design Philosophy
- RESTful and predictable
- Minimal required fields
- Flexible data types
- Clear error messages
- Consistent response formats

## Target Use Cases

### Personal Logging
- Quick measurements (weight, temperature, etc.)
- Temporary notes and reminders
- Data collection for personal projects
- Simple journaling or tracking

### IoT and Automation
- Sensor data logging
- Simple event tracking
- Status updates from devices
- Lightweight telemetry

## Success Metrics

- **Performance**: < 200ms average response time
- **Usability**: Users can log data in under 5 seconds
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime
- **Adoption**: Users return to log data regularly
